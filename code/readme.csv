Notice: Although it is only a demo code, it should also be confidential. 
This is a requirement of NEC Labs America. 

<1> How to use
step-1: generate signature matrices (train/test matrices) by running python matrix_generator.py
step-2: model training or test by running python MSCRED_TF.py (--train_test_label 1/0)
step-3: after running model test, model will return recontructed matrices of test period, then evaluate model performance by running python evaluate.py

<2> 
synthetic_data_with_anomaly-s-1.csv: sample time series raw data
test_anomaly.csv: anomaly position and root causes of sample data

<3> Please remember to cite our paper.
